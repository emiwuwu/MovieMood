## About MovieMood

### Project Description

MovieMood is a comprehensive project that combines two essential components: Sentiment Analysis and a Movie Recommendation System. These components are thoughtfully designed to provide insights into movie reviews and offer movie suggestions to users based on movie descriptions.

### Sentiment Analysis

**Sentiment analysis**, also known as opinion mining, is a powerful technique for extracting the emotional tone or sentiment expressed in a text. In this repository, sentiment analysis is applied to assess movie reviews and classify them as either positive or negative based on their content.

#### Key Features:

- Preprocessing of text data.
- Utilization of natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
- Sentiment classification is achieved through the implementation of deep neural network algorithms, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

### Movie Recommendation System

The **Movie Recommendation System** is created to assist users in discovering new movies that align with their preferences. It employs content-based approaches to generate movie recommendations.

#### Key Features:

- Visual representation of movie popularity and ratings.
- Content-based recommendations: Movies are suggested based on their descriptions.
